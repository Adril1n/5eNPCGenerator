Any flesh-and-blood creature in the cloud when it appears, or that enters it later, must make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw. On a successful save, the creature can't be infected by these spores for 24 hours. On a failed save, the creature is infected with a disease called the spores of Zuggtmoy and also gains a random form of indefinite madness (determined by rolling on the Madness of Zuggtmoy table in appendix D) that lasts until the creature is cured of the disease or dies. While infected in this way, the creature can't be reinfected, and it must be repeat the saving throw at the end of every 24 hours, ending the infection on a success. On a failure, the infected creature's body is slowly taken over by fungal growth, and after three such failed saves, the creature dies and is reanimated as a spore servant if it's a type of creature that can be (see the &quot;Myconids&quot; entry in the Monster Manual)." />

On its turn, the carrion stalker can detach itself from the target by using 5 feet of movement. When it dies, the carrion stalker detaches from any creature it is attached to. Larval Burst (1/Day). The carrion stalker releases a burst of larvae in a 10-foot-radius sphere centered on itself. Each creature in that area must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned. A creature poisoned in this way takes 7 (2d6) poison damage at the start of each of its turns as larvae infest its body. The creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

The larvae remain in the corpse, and one survives to become a fully grown carrion stalker in 1d4 weeks.

The aging effect can be reversed with a greater restoration spell, but only within 24 hours of it occurring. Possession (Recharge 6). One humanoid that Celeste can see within 5 feet of it must succeed on a DC 13 Charisma saving throw or be possessed by Celeste; Celeste then disappears, and the target is incapacitated and loses control of its body. Celeste now controls the body but doesn't deprive the target of awareness. Celeste can't be targeted by any attack, spell, or other effect, except ones that turn undead, and it retains its alignment, Intelligence, Wisdom, Charisma, and immunity to being charmed and frightened. It otherwise uses the possessed target's statistics, but doesn't gain access to the target's knowledge, class features, or proficiencies.The possession lasts until the body drops to 0 hit points, Celeste ends it as a bonus action, or Celeste is turned or forced out by an effect like the dispel evil and good spell. When the possession ends, Celeste reappears in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of the body. The target is immune to this ghost's Possession for 24 hours after succeeding on the saving throw or after the possession ends." />

If a target's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the target is immune to Ezzat's gaze for the next 24 hours. Disrupt Life (Costs 3 Actions). Each non-undead creature within 20 feet of Ezzat must make a DC 18 Constitution saving throw against this magic, taking 21 (6d6) necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one." />

Up to three other creatures of the hellfire engine's choice that it can see within 30 feet of the target must each make a DC 20 Dexterity saving throw, taking 22 (5d8) lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.5–6: Thunder Cannon.

She otherwise uses the possessed target's statistics, but doesn't gain access to the target's knowledge, class features, or proficiencies.The possession lasts until the body drops to 0 hit points, Leedara ends it as a bonus action, or Leedara is turned or forced out by an effect like the dispel evil and good spell. When the possession ends, Leedara reappears in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of the body. The target is immune to Leedara's Possession for 24 hours after succeeding on the saving throw or after the possession ends. Change Shape. Leedara magically assumes the appearance she had in life, and her creature type changes to Humanoid, while retaining her other game statistics. This transformation ends if Leedara is reduced to 0 hit points or uses an action to end it." />

If this effect reduces the target's hit point maximum to 0, the target dies, and if the target was evil, its soul is trapped in Morgantha's soul bag.

On each of its turns while berserk, the tomb guardian attacks the nearest creature it can see.

Once the tomb guardian goes berserk, it continues to do so until it is destroyed or regains all its hit points.

If he can't transform, he is destroyed.While he has 0 hit points in mist form, he can't revert to his vampire form, and he must reach his coffin within 2 hours or be destroyed. Once in his coffin, he reverts to his vampire form. He is then paralyzed until he regains at least 1 hit point. After 1 hour in his coffin with 0 hit points, he regains 1 hit point. Regeneration.

A humanoid slain in this way and then buried in the ground rises the following night as a vampire spawn under Strahd's control. Charm. Strahd targets one humanoid he can see within 30 feet of him. If the target can see Strahd, the target must succeed on a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw against this magic or be charmed. The charmed target regards Strahd as a trusted friend to be heeded and protected. The target isn't under Strahd's control, but it takes Strahd's requests and actions in the most favorable way and lets Strahd bite it.Each time Strahd or his companions do anything harmful to the target, it can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success. Otherwise, the effect lasts 24 hours or until Strahd is destroyed, is on a different plane of existence than the target, or takes a bonus action to end the effect. Children of the Night (1/Day).

		<dataval key="traits" value=" Shapechanger. If Zorak isn't in sunlight or running water, he can use his action to polymorph into a Tiny bat or a Medium cloud of mist, or back into his true form.While in bat form, Zorak can't speak, his walking speed is 5 feet, and he has a flying speed of 30 feet. His statistics, other than his size and speed, are unchanged. Anything he is wearing transforms with it, but nothing he is carrying does. He reverts to his true form if he dies.While in mist form, Zorak can't take any actions, speak, or manipulate objects. He is weightless, has a flying speed of 20 feet, can hover, and can enter a hostile creature's space and stop there. In addition, if air can pass through a space, the mist can do so without squeezing, and he can't pass through water. He has advantage on Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution saving throws, and he is immune to all nonmagical damage, except the damage he takes from sunlight. Dwarven Resilience. Augrek has advantage on saving throws against poison. Legendary Resistance (3/Day). If Zorak fails a saving throw, he can choose to succeed instead. Misty Escape. When he drops to 0 hit points outside his resting place, Zorak transforms into a cloud of mist (as in the Shapechanger trait) instead of falling unconscious, provided that he isn't in sunlight or running water. If he can't transform, he is destroyed.While he has 0 hit points in mist form, he can't revert to his vampire form, and he must reach his resting place within 2 hours or be destroyed. Once in his resting place, he reverts to his vampire form. He is then paralyzed until he regains at least 1 hit point. After spending 1 hour in his resting place with 0 hit points, he regains 1 hit point. Regeneration. Zorak regains 20 hit points at the start of his turn if he has at least 1 hit point and isn't in sunlight or running water. If Zorak takes radiant damage or damage from holy water, this trait doesn't function at the start of Zorak's next turn. Spider Climb. Zorak can climb difficult surfaces, including upside down on ceilings, without needing to make an ability check. Vampire Weaknesses. Zorak has the following flaws:Forbiddance. Zorak can't enter a residence without an invitation from one of the occupants.Harmed by Running Water. Zorak takes 20 acid damage if he ends his turn in running water.Stake to the Heart. If a piercing weapon made of wood is driven into Zorak's heart while Zorak is incapacitated in his resting place, Zorak is paralyzed until the stake is removed.Sunlight Hypersensitivity. Zorak takes 20 radiant damage when he starts his turn in sunlight. While in sunlight, he has disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks." />
		<dataval key="actions" value=" Multiattack. Zorak makes two attacks with his dwarven thrower, only one of which can be a ranged attack. Dwarven Thrower. Melee or Ranged Weapon Attack: +12 to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 20/60 ft., one target. Hit: 11 (1d8 + 7) bludgeoning damage, or 12 (1d10 + 7) bludgeoning damage when used with two hands to make a melee attack. On a ranged attack that hits, the hammer deals an extra 1d8 bludgeoning damage (2d8 if the target is a giant). Hit or Miss: If thrown, the weapon flies back to Zorak's hand after the attack. Multiattack (Vampire Form Only). Zorak makes two attacks, only one of which can be a bite attack. Unarmed Strike (Vampire Form Only). Melee Weapon Attack: +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 8 (1d8 + 4) bludgeoning damage. Instead of dealing damage, Zorak can grapple the target (escape DC 18). Bite (Bat or Vampire Form Only). Melee Weapon Attack: +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one willing creature, or a creature that is grappled by Zorak, incapacitated, or restrained. Hit: 7 (1d6 + 4) piercing damage plus 10 (3d6) necrotic damage. The target's hit point maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the necrotic damage taken, and Zorak regains hit points equal to that amount. The reduction lasts until the target finishes a long rest. The target dies if this effect reduces his hit point maximum to 0. A humanoid slain in this way and then buried in the ground rises the following night as a vampire spawn under Zorak's control. Charm. Zorak targets one humanoid he can see within 30 feet of it. If the target can see Zorak, the target must succeed on a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw against this magic or be charmed by Zorak. The charmed target regards Zorak as a trusted friend to be heeded and protected. Although the target isn't under Zorak's control, it takes Zorak's requests or actions in the most favorable way it can, and it is a willing target for Zorak's bite attack.Each time Zorak or Zorak's companions do anything harmful to the target, it can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success. Otherwise, the effect lasts 24 hours or until Zorak is destroyed, is on a different plane of existence than the target, or takes a bonus action to end the effect. Children of the Night (1/Day). Zorak magically calls 2d4 swarms of bats or rats, provided that the sun isn't up. While outdoors, Zorak can call 3d6 wolves instead. The called creatures arrive in 1d4 rounds, acting as allies of Zorak and obeying his spoken commands. The beasts remain for 1 hour, until Zorak dies, or until Zorak dismisses them as a bonus action." />
